## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help us improve our coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out this preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Its users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for interactive elements
